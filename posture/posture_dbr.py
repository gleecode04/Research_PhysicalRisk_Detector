"""Decision-Based Rule (DBR) engine for live Polar H10 posture monitoring.

Pure decision logic, no I/O -- mirrors posture_feedback.py's "no I/O on
purpose" design so this is independently unit-testable without a Bluetooth
connection, a browser, or a TTS engine. posture_live_bridge.py is the I/O
loop around it (buffers readings, calls these functions, speaks the result).

Thresholds and the cause taxonomy come from the instructor's "DBR Posture" /
"Feedback System Posture" spec sheet (Pitch/Roll/Yaw thresholds, Good/Bad/
Critical posture levels, and a Cause column: Forward Bending, Twisting/
Rotation, Overhead Work, Asymmetric Lifting, Static Posture).

Why tilt-from-neutral instead of a fixed-axis pitch formula
-------------------------------------------------------------
The original single-axis formula, pitch = atan2(ax, sqrt(ay^2+az^2)), reads
"forward lean" off one specific accelerometer axis. That only works if the
sensor is always mounted the same way relative to the body (e.g. flat
against the chest, with a known axis pointing "up"). Strapped to the lower
back instead, the device's local axes are rotated relative to that
assumption -- which is exactly why a neutral standing posture was reading
~-45 degrees, and a full forward bend was reading ~-2 degrees: the axis the
formula reads as "forward tilt" isn't the axis that actually tracks forward
tilt for this mount point, so the output isn't even monotonic with real
bending.

tilt_angle_deg() fixes this by calibrating a neutral gravity-vector baseline
at the start of each session (the wearer holds still in a neutral pose for
~1s) and then reporting the angle *between* the live gravity vector and that
calibrated neutral vector. That's mount-orientation-agnostic: it is 0
degrees at neutral by construction, and grows monotonically the further the
body tilts away from neutral in *any* direction, regardless of which raw
axis that motion happens to show up on.

    variation); Twisting is an oscillating sign flip across two axes;
    Overhead Work is high *variation* (not a sustained shift) concentrated
    on one axis, the signature of a moving arm/shoulder coupling into the
    trunk sensor; Asymmetric Lifting is variation spread diffusely across
    all three axes with no single dominant direction.

    Static Posture is deliberately NOT one of this function's outputs: a
    single ~1s window held steady is just normal controlled bending (e.g.
    reaching, lifting), not yet the sustained-minutes pattern the sheet's
    Static Posture row describes. That's a duration concept spanning many
    windows, so it's handled separately by escalate_for_static_duration()
    rather than guessed from one window's low variance here -- otherwise
    every calm, deliberate bend would get mislabeled "static" immediately.

    Caveat: this is a single lower-back accelerometer, not a full-body
    motion-capture rig. Overhead Work and Asymmetric Lifting in particular
    are proxies inferred from how the trunk responds to arm/load work, not a
    direct measurement of arm height or load symmetry -- treat them as
